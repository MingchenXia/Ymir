\section{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}

In the whole project, a neighbourhood in a topology space is taken in Bourbaki's sense. In particular, a neighbourhood is not necessarily open.

We follow Bourbaki's convention about compact space. A comapct space is always Hausdorff. 

On the other hand, we do not require locally compact spaces and paracompact spaces be Hausdorff.

\section{Nets}\label{sec-nets}

Let $X$ be a set, $Y\subseteq X$ be a subset. Consider a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$, we write
\[
    \tau|_Y:=\left\{V\in \tau: V\subseteq Y \right\}.    
\]

\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a topology space and $\tau$ be a collection of subsets of $X$. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We say $\tau$ is \emph{dense} if for any $V\in \tau$ and any $x\in V$, there is a fundamental system of neighbourhoods of $x$ in $V$ consisting of sets from $\tau|_V$.
        \item We say $\tau$ is a \emph{quasi-net} on $X$ if for each $x\in X$, there exist $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, $V_1,\ldots,V_n\in \tau$ such that $x\in V_1\cap \cdots\cap V_n$ and that $V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_n$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.
        \item We say $\tau$ is a \emph{net} on $X$ if it is a quasi-net and if for any $U,V\in \tau$, $\tau|_{U\cap V}$ is a quasi-net on $U\cap V$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
We observe that if $\tau$ is a net, $\tau|_{U\cap V}$ is in fact a net.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $\tau$ be a quasi-net on $X$. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A subset $U\subseteq X$ is open if and only if for each $V\in \tau$, $U\cap V$ is open in $V$.
        \item Suppose that $\tau$ consists of compact sets. Then $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if for any $U,V\in \tau$, $U\cap V$ is compact.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
We remind the readers that a compact space is Hausdorff by our convention.
\begin{proof}
    (1) The direct implication is trivial. Suppose that $U\cap V$ is open in $V$ for all $V\in \tau$. We want to show that $U$ is open. Take $x\in U$, we can find $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, $V_1,\ldots,V_n\in \tau$ all containing $x$ such that $V_1\cup \cdots \cup V_n$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$. By our hypothesis, we can find open sets $W_1,\ldots,W_n$ in $W$ such that $W\cap V_i=U\cap V_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$. Then $W=W_1\cap \cdots\cap W_n$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$. But then
    \[
        U\cap (V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_n)\supseteq W\cap   (V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_n),
    \]
    the latter is a neighbourhood of $x$ hence so is the former. It follows that $U$ is open.

    (2) The direct implication is trivial. Consider the quasi-net $\tau\times\tau:=\{U\times V: U,V\in \tau\}$ on $X\times X$. 
    By (1), it suffices to verify that the intersection of the diagonal with $U\times V$ is closed in $U\times V$  for any $U,V\in \tau$. But this intersection is homeomorphic to $U\cap V$, which is compact by our assumption and hence closed as $U$, $V$ are both Hausdorff.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lma-quasinetimplyloccpt}
    Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. Assume that $X$ admits a quasi-net $\tau$ consisting of compact sets. Then $X$ is locally compact.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Take $x\in X$. By assumption, we can find $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $V_1,\ldots,V_n\in \tau$ all containing $x$ such that $V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_n$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. This neighbourhood is clearly compact.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space and $\tau$ be a collection of compact subsets of $X$. Then the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\tau$ is a quasi-net;
        \item For each $x\in X$, there are $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $V_1,\ldots,V_n\in \tau$ such that $V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_n$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    (1) $\implies$ (2): This is trivial.

    (2) $\implies$ (1): Given $x\in X$, take $V_1,\ldots,V_n$ as in (2). We may assume that $x\in V_1,\ldots,V_m$ and $x\not\in V_{m+1},\ldots,V_n$ for some $1\leq m\leq n$. Then $V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_m$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$: if $U$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$ contained in $V_1\cup \cdots\cup V_n$, then $U\setminus (V_{m+1}\cup\cdots \cup V_n)$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$ contained in $V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_m$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lma-netproperty1}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $\tau$ be a net on $X$ consisting of compact sets. Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item for any pair $U,V\in \tau$, the intersection $U\cap V$ is locally closed in $U$ and in $V$;
        \item If $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, $V,V_1,\ldots,V_n\in \tau$ are such that 
            \[
                V\subseteq V_1\cup \cdots\cup V_n,
            \]
            then there are $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and $U_1,\ldots,U_m\in \tau$ such that 
            \[
                V=U_1\cup\cdots\cup U_m  
            \]
            and each $U_j$ is contained in some $V_i$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    (1) It suffices to show that $U\cap V$ is locally compact in the induced topology. This follows from \cref{lma-quasinetimplyloccpt}.
    
    (2) For each $x\in V$ and each $i=1,\ldots,n$ such that $x\in V_i$, we take a neighbourhood of $x$ in $V\cap V_i$ of the form $W_iV_{i1}\cup\cdots\cup V_{im_i}$ for some $m_i\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and $V_{ij}\in \tau$ for $j=1,\ldots,m_i$. Then the union of all $W_i$'s is a neighbourhood of $x$ of the form $U_1\cup \cdots U_m$, where $U_j$ belongs to $\tau$ and is contained in some $V_i$. Using the compactness of $V$, we conclude.
\end{proof}

\section{Bornology}
\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a set. A \emph{bornology} on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For any $x\in X$, there is $B\in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in \mathcal{B}$;
        \item For any $B\in \mathcal{B}$ and any subset $A\subseteq B$, $A\in \mathcal{B}$;
        \item $\mathcal{B}$ is stable under finite union.
    \end{enumerate}

    The pair $(X,\mathcal{B})$ is called a \emph{bornological set}. The elements of $\mathcal{B}$ are called the \emph{bounded subsets} of $(X,\mathcal{B})$. When $\mathcal{B}$ is obvious from the context, we omit it from the notations.
    
    A morphism between bornological sets $(X,\mathcal{B}_X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B}_Y)$ is a map of sets $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that for any $A\in \mathcal{B}_X$, $f(A)\in \mathcal{B}_Y$. Such a map is called a \emph{bounded map}.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    Let $(X,\mathcal{B})$ be a bornological set. A \emph{basis} for $\mathcal{B}$ is a subset $\mathcal{A}\subseteq \mathcal{B}$ such that for any $B\in \mathcal{B}$, there are $A_1,\ldots,A_n\in \mathcal{A}$ such that $B\subseteq A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_n$.
\end{definition}
