# Ymir
This is intended to be a Stacks Project for complex analytic spaces and non-Archimedean analytic spaces.

Ymir is a giant from Nordic mythology, who gave birth to a male and a female from his armpits. For us, Yamir contains two subclasses: a complex analytic part and a rigid analytic/Berkovich analytic part.

We will freely make use of all results from Stacks Project.
