## Introduction
This is intended to be a [Stacks Project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu) for complex analytic spaces and non-Archimedean analytic spaces.

Ymir is a giant from Nordic mythology, who gave birth to a male and a female from his armpits. For us, Ymir contains two subclasses: a complex analytic part and a rigid analytic/Berkovich analytic part.

We will freely make use of all results from Stacks Project.
 

## Current structure

### Part 1 Preliminaries

- [Topology and Bornology](Topology-Bornology.pdf)

> To do: Include the theory of nets and quasi-nets.

- [Banach rings](Banach-Rings.pdf)

> To do: include the Archimedean theory

- [Commutative algebra](Commutative-Algebra.pdf)

> To do: include further details.

### Part 2 Complex analytic spaces

- [Complex analytic local algebras](Local-Algebras.pdf)

- [The notion of complex analytic spaces](Complex-Analytic-Spaces.pdf)

> To do: include the notion of open/closed immersions.

### Part 3 Non-Archimedean analytic spaces

- [Affinoid algebras](Affinoid-Algebras.pdf)

> To do: include Temkin's proof of the Gerritzen--Grauert theorem; Ducros' proof of the excellence of affinoid algebras.

> Unfortunately, I cannot figure out why Temkin's version of Gerritzen--Grauert theorem implies the usual statement: each affinoid domain is a finite union of affinoid domains. See the remark in this chapter for details!
