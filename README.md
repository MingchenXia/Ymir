# Ymir

## Introduction

This is intended to be a [Stacks Project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu) for complex analytic spaces and non-Archimedean analytic spaces.

Ymir is a giant from Nordic mythology, who gave birth to a male and a female from his armpits. For us, Ymir contains two subclasses: a complex analytic part and a rigid analytic/Berkovich analytic part.

We will freely make use of all results from Stacks Project.

## Current structure

### Part 1 Preliminaries

- [Topology and Bornology](aux/Topology-Bornology.pdf)


- [Banach rings](aux/Banach-Rings.pdf)

> To do: include the Archimedean theory

> To do: include further details.

### Part 2 Complex analytic spaces

- [Complex analytic local algebras](aux/Local-Algebras.pdf)
